Project idea
An application for kids to learn about the real-world impact of their actions on their immediate environment. It would use the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals as a framework to engage users in activities, games, quizzes, and challenges.It's a fun and informative way to inspire the next generation of global citizens!

Project background/Business Opportunity
WHY?

In a presentation from a sustainabilty director, he mentioned how the awareness of  the UN SDGs is not globalized. He also mentioned that kids that don't speak english in Asia know the phrase "UN SDGs" but its not the same  in North America. It's imperative that children understand how their actions can impact their immediate surroundings and contribute to these global objectives.

To address this gap and make a meaningful difference, I am embarking on this journey to develop a user-friendly, interactive, and educational application. Using Swift, which I've long intended to master, I plan to create an app specifically designed for iPad users aged 8 and above.

This innovative application will serve as a platform for kids to explore, engage, and learn about the SDGs. It will include a variety of activities, from games and quizzes to interactive challenges. Through these activities, children can make choices and receive instant feedback on how these choices align with the SDGs. Each SDG will be presented as a distinct module or level, with the completion of each module marking a significant milestone. This modular approach will enable me continually refine and improve the app, ensuring that each module functions as a minimum viable product (MVP).

My project not only aims to address a critical educational need but also presents a substantial business opportunity. By fostering a sense of social and environmental responsibility in children and by actively contributing to their education about the SDGs, it could potentially become integrated into teaching curriculum and it could be used as a means for teachers to educate kids.
